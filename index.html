		<h2>Major: Visual Communication Design</h2>

		<p>I recently switched from Computer Science, which I am now minoring in, to Visual Communication Design to focus on user experience design.</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<p>Initially intending to major in Astrophysics upon enrolling at Washington State University, I developed a strong background in mathematics and science. Waning personal interest in physics paired with wanting something more applied lead to a change of majors after time off from university - Mechanical Engineering then Computer Science. During that time, I also took photography classes and began to develop a strong interest. A developing interest in ergonomics and interfaces, paired with a growing understanding in visual arts and designed brought on by photography, resulted in the change to Visual Communication Design. </p>

		<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>

		<p>To develop interfaces for software and hardware that is intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. The details in how users connect with their devices are constantly changing. Content is delivered across a broad array of platforms and I want to make it work for the user - what good is information if is hidden away in convoluted design? Conventions like QWERTY are holding back how people interact with their devices, and as touch driven devices continue to grow, a solution needs to be found.</p>
